# cal :calendar:

Unpretentious calendar app

### Why

Mainstream calendar apps are too cluttered and their forms are too lenghty. I used to organize my tasks and events in a draft message in gmail so I made this webpage for convenience.

### TODO
- Make it a PWA;
- Night mode;
- Add different auth providers.
